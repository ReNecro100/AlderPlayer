# AlderPlayer
Alderplay is an audio player I developed over several months in the spring and summer of 2025, attempting to replicate the concept of vinyl players and vinyl records. Its primary function is to play Aldervinyls—folders containing several audio (.mp3) files and, optionally, cover art (.png).
